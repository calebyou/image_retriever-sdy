# Image Analysis and Data Retrieval Project

This project is designed to read image files, analyze the content of the images, and retrieve the relevant data embedded within each image. The processed output is saved in JSON format, containing the image name and a detailed description of the image (if present in the image).

## Features

- Read and process multiple image file formats.
- Analyze image content for embedded text and descriptions.
- Retrieve relevant data from the image.
- Generate a JSON file containing:
  - Image file name.
  - Detailed description or text found within the image.

## Output Format

The output will be structured in a JSON file with the following format:

```json
{
  "image_name": "example_image.png",
  "image_description": "Description or text found within the image"
}
